## Logistic Regression System (From Scratch)

1. **What this project is**
> **Logistic Regression system built from scratch with system-level evaluation and threshold tuning.**
2. **What problems it models**
>  **Binary decision-making systems (fraud, eligibility, risk).**
3. **System architecture**
> Input → Model → Probability → Threshold → Decision
4. **How to run**
> pyton run.py
5. **What can be tuned without retraining**
- Threshold
- Evaluation focus (precision vs recall)
6. **What this project proves**
- Model not equal system
- Accuracy can lie
- Threshold controls business behavior
